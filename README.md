﻿# Racing Calendar

This project is part of Zero to Mastery's [C# course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/csharp-net-bootcamp/). The goal is to implement a racing calendar for a fictional racing series. The primary focus for this project is to practice using different .NET collections in a console app. It allows the user to set the races' lineups with a random selection of drivers. Then the user can remove any driver and replace them with the next-in-line driver on that race's waitlist.

## Requirements

- [x] Implement a class that represents a race. Attributes should include the name of the race, date of the race, and the name of the track.
- [x] Select a .NET collection and add a few races to form a racing calendar.
- [x] Print all races to the console and include all available information.
- [x] Implement a driver class with a name property.
- [x] Only 5 drivers are allowed to compete in a race. Add a method to the Race class that allows adding drivers to a race until the starting grid is full.
- [x] Add a driver to any race. If the driver is successfully added, print a message.
- [x] Simulate a waiting list. Choose a .NET collection to store drivers on the waiting list. You should be able to take the next driver from the list. The driver taken from the waitlist should be the driver first in line.
